# Work In Progress – Frontendpedia Platform

## Current Focus (Sep 30, 2025)
- ✅ Implemented onboarding flow with 5 steps and stateful API backend
- ✅ Restored middleware for auth + onboarding guard
- ✅ Updated Prisma schema/seed for `PRO_PLUS` tier and new role mappings
- ✅ Installed Zustand store and orchestrated onboarding step components
- ✅ Added onboarding documentation to blueprint and implementation summary

## Outstanding Follow-ups
- Wire Stripe checkout for Pro / Pro Plus tiers
- Hook onboarding completion to analytics events + welcome notifications
- Add unit tests for `useOnboardingStore` actions and API route
- Design celebratory post-completion UI + guided tour

## Notes
- All onboarding client components live under `src/components/onboarding`
- API contract is `GET/PATCH /api/onboarding`; persisted to Prisma user profile/subscription tables
- Middleware located at `src/app/middleware.ts` now enforces onboarding redirection
